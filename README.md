# betterPackOpener
A Yugioh pack opening alternative made in Python. 
The main reason why I made this was to have a more accurate pack opener, the most popular one has lots of mistakes and doesn't work as it should. The other reason was to have a pack opener that lets you open 24 packs as if they were a box and not stray packs.
